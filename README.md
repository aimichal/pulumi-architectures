# Pulumi Architectures

This repo contains some modern cloud architectures across multiple clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes) and
written using Pulumi Infrastructure as Code across multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, C#, and Go).

      ([Py](./aws-py-base-infra), [TS](./aws-ts-base-infra), [C#](./aws-cs-base-infra), [Go](./aws-go-base-infra))
* **Load-Balanced Virtual Machines**: _coming soon!_

* **Web Service and Database**: _coming soon!_
* **Serverless Application**: _coming soon!_
